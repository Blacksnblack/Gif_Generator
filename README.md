# Gif_Generator

An application made mainly from Tkinter and Pillow used to create gifs from a directory of images. Can scale images down by setting max height/width and can change the speed per image in milliseconds with a slider. 

Images must be pre-organized and contained in a single folder; not in any subfolders. Generated gifs will be stored inside a new folder, 'generated' 
inside the folder containing the images
